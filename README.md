Mapping of Access and Usage of Insecticide-Treated Nets in Nigeria

Malaria remains a major public health challenge in Nigeria with children under five years of age and pregnant women possessing the highest risk. Preventive efforts including indoor residual spraying (IRS) and insecticide-treated nets (ITN) have been implemented over the years but issues such as limited funding, low net coverage, and cultural barriers have hindered progress. This study analyzes ITN ownership and usage trends across Nigeria to assess local-level variations and differences based on household size.

This study used data from the Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) and the Nigeria Malaria Indicators Survey (NMIS) to analyze access and usage trends over seven distinct years (2003, 2008, 2013, 2018, 2010, 2015, and 2020).
A Bayesian spatio-temporal model was applied to capture variations in access and usage. The model was estimated using Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA).

The codes used in the analysis are available on this repository.
